Florida State SkillsUSA Web Design Contest

THEME: The MTC SkillsUSA Chapter

Technical Notes: 
The purpose of the contest is to evaluate contestants’ Web design skills and their readiness for employment.
Contestants should demonstrate:
-	understanding the purpose of the Website and target audience needs
-	knowledge of Website Web technology standards
-	knowledge of Website accessibility standards
-	knowledge of best practices for designing a Web site, such as page layout design concepts and principles, usability, and separating content from design, 
-	search engine optimization

Due to lack of time and initial content, contestants are not required to design a fully finished, “turn key” web site. You can use the Lorem Ipsum text (or any other placeholder text) for details. However, contestants should demonstrate the logic of the content organization and show the placement of the main elements of the content, such as Articles, Current News, Testimonials, and etc.


In addition, contestants will be offered one JavaScript challenge.
